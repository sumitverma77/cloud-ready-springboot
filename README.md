## Overview

This repository contains a Spring Boot application that is Dockerized and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance using a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. This README provides a detailed guide from creating the project to deploying it with CI/CD.

## Prerequisites

*   AWS Account
*   EC2 Instance
*   Docker Hub Account
*   GitHub Repository
*   Java Development Kit (JDK)
*   Maven
*   Basic knowledge of Spring Boot, Docker, and GitHub Actions

## Workflow

1. **Push to GitHub**: Developer pushes code changes to the main branch.
2. **GitHub Actions Trigger**: The workflow detects changes in src/, Dockerfile, or pom.xml.
3. **Build and Push**:
    - Checks out the code.
    - Caches Maven dependencies and Docker layers to reduce build time.
    - Builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
    - Pushes the image to Docker Hub.
4. **Deploy to EC2**:
    - SSH into the EC2 instance.
    - Pulls the latest Docker image.
    - Stops/removes any existing container named app.
    - Frees port 80 if occupied.
    - Runs a new container with the updated image.
5. **Test with Postman**: Send requests to http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/api/hello to verify the application.

## Creating the Spring Boot Project

1.  **Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr:**
    *   [Image of Spring Initializr configuration]
2.  **Add dependencies:**
    *   Spring Web
    *   Spring Boot DevTools

## Adding Endpoints

1.  **Create a controller class:**

    ```java
    @RestController
    public class AppController {

       
       @PostMapping("/echo")
       public ResponseEntity<Map<String, Object>> echo(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> input) {
        log.info("Received /echo request with body: {}", input);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(input);
       }

        @GetMapping("/status")
        public String status() {
            return "OK";
        }
    }
    ```

    This code creates a simple controller with two endpoints: `/echo` and `/status`.

## Pushing to GitHub

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository:**
2.  **Initialize a Git repository in the project directory:**

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

    This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

3.  **Add the project files to the repository:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    This command adds all the files in the current directory to the staging area.

4.  **Commit the changes:**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

    This command commits the changes with a message "Initial commit".

5.  **Push the repository to GitHub:**

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <repository_url>
    git push -u origin main
    ```

    *   `git remote add origin <repository_url>`: This command adds a remote repository named "origin" with the specified URL.
    *   `git push -u origin main`: This command pushes the local "main" branch to the remote "origin" repository and sets up tracking.

## Configuration

### application.properties

```properties
spring.application.name=cloud-ready-springboot
server.port=9000
server.address=0.0.0.0
```

This file configures the Spring Boot application.

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/*.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 9000

CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

This file defines the steps to build the Docker image.

## Deployment Steps

1.  **Create an EC2 Instance:**
2.  **Install Docker on EC2:**
3.  **Configure Docker Hub Credentials:**

## Deploy Docker Image on EC2 from the terminal
1.  Open an SSH client (I have used `Bash` for Widnows).
2.  Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is `headout-task-key.pem`.
3.  Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable:

    ```bash
    chmod 400 "headout-task-key.pem"
    ```

4.  **Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH:**

    ```bash
    ssh -i "headout-task-key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-232-184-7.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
    ```

    Replace `ec2-user@ec2-13-232-184-7.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com` with your EC2 instance's public IP address and Replace `eheadout-task-key.pem"` with your kay name.

#### âœ… _Now we can access EC2 Instance from the terminal_.

#### 1. Install Docker on the EC2 Instance

To run Docker containers, you need to install Docker on your EC2 instance.

`sudo yum install docker`

This command installs Docker using the YUM package manager.

#### 2. Verify Docker Installation

Verify Docker is installed correctly by checking its version:

`docker --version`

The command will display the installed version (e.g., Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701).

#### 3. Start and Enable the Docker Service

Start Docker and enable it to launch on system boot:

`sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker`

Verify that Docker is running:

`sudo systemctl status docker`

#### 4. Pull the Spring Boot Docker Image

Download the Spring Boot application image from Docker Hub:

`sudo docker pull sumitverma77/cloud-ready-springboot`

#### 5. Verify the Docker Image

Confirm the image was downloaded successfully:

`sudo docker images`

Look for sumitverma77/cloud-ready in the list of images.

#### 6. Run the Spring Boot Application

Launch the application in a Docker container with port mapping:

`sudo docker run --rm -d -p 80:9000 sumitverma77/cloud-ready`

- --rm: Automatically removes the container when it stops
- -d: Runs the container in detached mode (background)
- -p 80:9000: Maps port 80 on the EC2 instance to port 9000 in the container

## Accessing the Application

Once the container is running, you can access the Spring Boot application by navigating to `http://[EC2_PUBLIC_IP] `in your web browser, where `[EC2_PUBLIC_IP]` is the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
  
## Checking the Running Port

1.  **Check if the application is running on port 80:**

    ```bash
    sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 80
    ```

    This command lists all the processes listening on port 80.

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline.

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME }}:latest

  deploy:
    needs: build-and-push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to EC2 via SSH
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ec2-user
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            echo "Pulling latest image..."
            sudo docker pull ${{ secrets.DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME }}:latest

            echo "Stopping old container (if any)..."
            sudo docker stop app || echo "No container named 'app' was running."

            echo "Removing old container (if any)..."
            sudo docker rm -f app || echo "No container named 'app' to remove."

            # Check and free port 80 if occupied
            PORT_OCCUPIED_CONTAINER=$(sudo docker ps --filter "publish=80" --format "{{.ID}}")
            if [ -n "$PORT_OCCUPIED_CONTAINER" ]; then
              echo "Port 80 is occupied by container $PORT_OCCUPIED_CONTAINER, stopping it..."
              sudo docker stop "$PORT_OCCUPIED_CONTAINER"
              sudo docker rm "$PORT_OCCUPIED_CONTAINER"
            fi

            sleep 2  # wait a bit to ensure cleanup

            echo "Running new container..."
            sudo docker run -d --name app -p 80:9000 ${{ secrets.DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME }}:latest

            echo "Current running containers:"
            sudo docker ps -a

            echo "Logs from new container (last 50 lines):"
            sudo docker logs --tail 50 app
```

This pipeline builds and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub and then deploys it to the EC2 instance via SSH.

## GitHub Secrets 
Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

* `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
* `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub access token or password.
* `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`: The Docker image name (e.g., sumitverma77/cloud-ready).
* `EC2_HOST`: The public IP or DNS of your EC2 instance.
* `EC2_SSH_KEY`: The private SSH key for the EC2 instance.

## Push Code to GitHub to Trigger Workflow
```
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main 
```

âœ… This push to the main branch will automatically start your GitHub Actions workflow.

## Assumptions and Decisions

### Assumptions





#### EC2 Instance Configuration:
* The EC2 instance runs Amazon Linux 2 with yum as the package manager.
* The ec2-user has sudo privileges and can execute Docker commands.
* Port 80 is open in the EC2 security group for application access, and port 22 is open for SSH.
#### Spring Boot Application:


The application is packaged as a JAR file (e.g., via Maven/Gradle) and runs on port 9000 inside the Docker container.



#### Docker Hub:

The Docker Hub repository (sumitverma77/cloud-ready-springboot) is publicly accessible or properly configured with credentials.


### Decisions
#### Docker Layer and Maven Caching:
* Added actions/cache@v4 and docker/setup-buildx-action@v3 to cache Docker layers and Maven dependencies, reducing rebuild time.

#### Port Management:

* _**Included a script to check and free port 80 on the EC2 instance to prevent conflicts during container deployment._**

#### Error Handling:

* Added fallback commands (e.g., sudo docker stop app || echo "No container named 'app' was running.") to handle cases where containers donâ€™t exist.
* Included container logs (sudo docker logs --tail 50 app) for debugging deployment issues.
